## critbit:

Implementation of djb's critbit tree structure, a clever kind of trie
that allows fast search among a set of strings, including prefix-search.

## quicklist:

A simple list that is better than (value, next) tuples in performance
and memory usage.

The tests in this repository depends on the [cutest](https://github.com/badgerman/cutest) module.
You may have to update the Makefile to point it to your local checkout.
